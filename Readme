# Email Automation Script

## Overview
This Python script automates the process of sending emails with attachments to professors listed in a CSV file. The script reads professor details from the CSV, formats a personalized email, attaches a CV, and sends the email via SMTP.

## Features
- Reads recipient details (professor names, emails, research areas) from a CSV file.
- Formats a personalized email message.
- Attaches a CV (PDF format) to each email.
- Sends emails through an SMTP server (Gmail).
- Handles missing data and errors gracefully.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries:
  ```sh
  pip install pandas smtplib email
  ```
- A Gmail account with **less secure app access enabled** or an **app password** generated.
- A properly formatted CSV file (`Dalian-University.csv`) with the following columns:
  - `university`
  - `field`
  - `professor`
  - `email`
  - `research`

## Installation & Usage
1. Clone this repository or download the script.
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/email-automation.git
   cd email-automation
   ```
2. Ensure the CSV file is in the same directory as the script.
3. Update `email_dats.py` with your email credentials:
   ```python
   Email = "your-email@gmail.com"
   password = "your-email-password"
   ```
4. Run the script:
   ```sh
   python send_emails.py
   ```

## CSV File Structure
Example CSV file format:
```
university,field,professor,email,research
Dalian University,Mechanical Engineering,Dr. John Doe,johndoe@example.com,Renewable Energy
```

## Email Content
Each email follows this template:
```
Dear Professor [Name],

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Muneeb Ahmed, a final-year Mechanical Engineering student at Air University, Pakistan. I am applying for a Masterâ€™s degree through the CSC Scholarship and am very interested in your research.

My final-year project, "Smart Helmet," focuses on enhancing safety and communication for workers in hazardous environments. I believe my background aligns well with your work, and I would be honored to contribute to your research.

I have attached my CV for your review. Please let me know if you need any further information. I look forward to your response.

Best regards,  
Muneeb Ahmed
```

## Error Handling
- If the CSV file is missing or improperly formatted, the script displays an error message and exits.
- If any recipient's email or professor's name is missing, that entry is skipped.
- If the SMTP connection fails, an error message is displayed.
